## Hi there 👋

### 👀 What does all this mean?  

There was a time when I felt the need for a Telegram channel that would publish interesting GitHub repositories. So, I armed myself with AI and created such a channel for myself.  

You can read more about it here (in Ukrainian):

As a result, I decided to publish all the code I had previously written for this project — and even added a few new integrations.

### 🤔 What should you do with all this? 

I don't know. I'm gifting this poorly written and unoptimized code to the world — what happens next is no longer my concern. Of course, I will maintain the code until I get bored.

### 🧬 Repositories structure  

Yeah, I know, there are too many of them, but I can't put all the code in one app, can I? 

### 🥇 Main repositories

- [content-alchemist](https://github.com/think-root/content-alchemist) – a sort of API server that helps generate nice descriptions for GitHub repositories. It also includes a database.  
- [content-maestro](https://github.com/think-root/content-maestro) – a tool that skillfully juggles content like a maestro. Simply put, it sends requests to various integrations with text (and sometimes images).
- [content-sentinel](https://github.com/think-root/content-sentinel) - a dashboard that provides insights and oversight for content operations, helping track, manage, and analyze content.

### 🥈 Integrations

I think it's clear here without any extra explanation.
