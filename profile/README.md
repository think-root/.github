# Hello there 👋

## What does all this mean?  

There was a time when I felt the need for a Telegram channel that would publish interesting GitHub repositories. So, I armed myself with AI and created such a channel for myself.  

You can read more about it [here](https://drukarnia.com.ua/articles/yak-shtuchnii-intelekt-vede-telegram-kanal-ta-ne-lishe-iogo-i-u-nogo-ce-chudovo-vikhodit-tnpeE) (in Ukrainian):  

As a result, I decided to publish all the code I had previously written for this project — and even added a few new integrations.

## What should you do with all this? 

I don't know. I'm gifting this poorly written and unoptimized code to the world — what happens next is no longer my concern. Of course, I will maintain the code until I get bored.

## Repositories structure  

Yeah, I know, there are too many of them, but I can't put all the code in one app, can I? 

### Main repositories

- [content-alchemist](https://github.com/think-root/content-alchemist) – An API server that allows you to generate nice descriptions for GitHub repositories using only a link to the repository
- [content-maestro](https://github.com/think-root/content-maestro) – Content management for "content-alchemist", scheduled content publication on social networks, and other features in the form of an API server
- [content-sentinel](https://github.com/think-root/content-sentinel) - Essentially, a frontend for "content-alchemist" and "content-maestro" in the form of a dashboard

### Social media integrations

- [telegram](https://github.com/think-root/telegram-connector)
- [twitter](https://github.com/think-root/x-connector)
- [bluesky](https://github.com/think-root/bluesky-connector)
- [whatsapp](https://github.com/think-root/whatsapp-connector)
