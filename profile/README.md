## Hi there 👋

### What does all this mean?  

There was a time when I felt the need for a Telegram channel that would publish interesting GitHub repositories. So, I armed myself with AI and created such a channel for myself.

As a result, I decided to publish all the code I had previously written for this project—and even added a few new integrations.

### What should you do with all this? 

I don't know. I'm gifting this poorly written and unoptimized code to the world—what happens next is no longer my concern.
