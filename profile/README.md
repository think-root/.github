## Hi there 👋

### What does all this mean?  

There was a time when I felt the need for a Telegram channel that would publish interesting GitHub repositories. So, I armed myself with AI and created such a channel for myself.  

You can read more about it here (in Ukrainian):

As a result, I decided to publish all the code I had previously written for this project—and even added a few new integrations.

### What should you do with all this? 

I don't know. I'm gifting this poorly written and unoptimized code to the world—what happens next is no longer my concern.

### Repositories structure  

Yeah, I know, there are too many of them

- [content-alchemist](https://github.com/think-root/content-alchemist) – a sort of API server that helps generate nice descriptions for GitHub repositories. It also includes a database.  
- [content-maestro](https://github.com/think-root/content-maestro) – a tool that skillfully juggles content like a maestro. Simply put, it sends requests to various integrations with text (and sometimes images).

### Integrations

I think it's clear here without any extra explanation.

- [telegram](https://github.com/think-root/telegram-connector)
- [whatsapp](https://github.com/think-root/whatsapp-connector)
- [twitter](https://github.com/think-root/x-connector)
- [bluesky](https://github.com/think-root/bluesky-connector) ⚠️ It's not ready yet ⚠️
